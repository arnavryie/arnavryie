# 👋 Hi there, I’m Arnav!

I’m a first-year Computer Science student who just started learning Python 🐍.  
Right now, I’m exploring coding basics, VS Code, and how to use GitHub properly.

## 🚀 What I’m up to:
- Learning Python step by step
- Forking interesting beginner-friendly projects to learn from
- Practicing small scripts and algorithms
- Trying out VS Code extensions and settings

## 🌱 My Goals:
- Build small projects in Python
- Understand how open source works
- Contribute tiny fixes in beginner repos
- Share what I learn along the way!

If you have any advice or beginner project ideas, feel free to reach out.  
Let’s grow together! 🌟
